## What is Plotto?

Plotto is an "algebra" for stories that an author (or storyteller) can use to help create works of fiction.

It is a collection of 1462 generic plot conflicts that can be chained together into a "masterplot" that forms the core plot structure for the story.

## Getting Started

The quickest way to get a feel of what Plotto offers is to simply jump to a [random plot conflict] and then begin exploring.

A detailed description of how to use Plotto can be found in the document.

It is important to note that the conflicts described in Plotto are not intended to be taken literally and applied verbatim.
Rather they are suggestions that you should adapt to fit the story that you want to tell.

## Plotto and Modern Times
Plotto was published in the late 20s and was written over the course of the preceding decades. During this period of history the Titanic sunk, we learned how to fly, there was a world war, and women gained the
right to vote in the US. Notably missing from this period are things that we often take for granted in the modern world, many conveniences afforded by advances in technology and significantly the notions of 
civil and equal rights.

While Plotto's disconnect from the modern world can be entertaining at times, as in the examples of "dare-devil" activity that include 

* a "trick" bicycle rider with a "loop the loop" speciality
* an aviator whose speciality is airplane stunts
* a "human fly" who climbs the walls of tall buildings
